# Chrome-Dino-Auto-Play
Modified version of the game file from "https://chromedino.com/" that makes the game play itself.

This modification can be applied by opening the game's webpage in a browser, opening the debugger, adding a script override to the file "https://chromedino.com/js/game.js?v=6", and substituting the content of the file override with the code from "./dino_game_m.js". For changes to apply, the page must be reloaded.
